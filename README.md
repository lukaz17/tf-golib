# T-Force Support Library Monorepo for Go

Collection of handy classes and utilities to supercharge Go application development.

## About

Back in the time I was a C# developer, the .NET Framework provided many helper functions and classes out-of-the-box, espcially the LINQ package. Those built-in utilities were very helpful at time, almost everyone used it.

To continue with momentum of application development we used to have in the past, I decided to make it happens in Go. I'm not sure that this library will be a unique idea, but I do hope that it can help other developers makes their application faster.
