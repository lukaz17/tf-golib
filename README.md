# T-Force Support Library Monorepo for Go

Collection of handy classes and utilities to supercharge Go application development.

## About

Back in the time I was a C# developer, the .NET Framework provided many helper functions and classes out-of-the-box, espcially the LINQ package. Those built-in utilities were very helpful at time, almost everyone used it.

To continue with momentum of application development we used to have in the past, I decided to make it happens in Go. I'm not sure that this library will be a unique idea, but I do hope that it can help other developers makes their application faster.

### 2025 Update: TF GoLib will change to MIT license since v0.7.0.

After some time spending efforts into this project. We found out that many greater projects even have MIT license, there is not any reason for TF GoLib to keep Apache-2.0. This is will make the license story less complicated for anyone who want to adopt TF GoLib into their projects.

## License

TF GoLib is licensed under MIT license. See LICENSE file for more details.
